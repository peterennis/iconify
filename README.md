This repository contains the new version, completely rewritten using modern development process.

## Iconify monorepo

This repository is a big monorepo that contains several implementations of Iconify icon framework.

There are two types of Iconify implementations:

-   Implementations that rely on icon packages.
-   Implementations that rely on Iconify API.

### Implementations: without API

These Iconify implementations require the developer to provide icon data and expect that icon data to be included in the bundle.

Examples: Iconify for React, Iconify for Vue.

They are easy to use and do not require an internet connection to work, similar to other React/Vue components.

### Implementations: with API

Iconify is designed to be easy to use. One of the main features is the Iconify API.

Iconify API provides data for over 60,000 icons! API is hosted on publicly available servers, spread out geographically to make sure visitors from all over the world have the fastest possible connection with redundancies in place to make sure it is always online.

#### Why is API needed?

When you use an icon font, each visitor loads an entire font, even if your page only uses a few icons. This is a major downside of using icon fonts. That limits developers to one or two fonts or icon sets.

Unlike icon fonts, Iconify implementations that use API do not load the entire icon set. Iconify only loads icons that are used on the current page.

This makes it possible to have an unlimited choice of icons!

Iconify API provides icon data to Iconify SVG framework and other implementations that rely on Iconify API.

## Available packages

There are several Iconify implementations included in this repository:

-   [Iconify core](./packages/core/) - common files used by various implementations.
-   [React demo](./packages/react-demo/) - demo for React component. Run `npm start` to start demo.
-   [React with API demo](./packages/react-demo-with-api/) - demo for React component that loads icons from Iconify API. Run `npm start` to start demo.
-   [Vue demo](./packages/vue-demo/) - demo for Vue component. Run `npm serve` to start demo.
-   [Svelte demo](./packages/svelte-demo/) - demo for Svelte component. Run `npm run dev` to start demo.
-   [Sapper demo](./packages/sapper-demo/) - demo for Sapper, using Svelte component on the server and in the browser. Run `npm run dev` to start the demo.
-   [Browser tests](./packages/browser-tests/) - unit tests for SVG framework. Run `npm run build` to build it. Open test.html in browser (requires HTTP server).

## Installation

This monorepo uses Lerna to manage packages.

First you need to install Lerna:

```bash
npm run install
```

To install dependencies in all packages, run

```bash
npm run bootstrap
```

This will install all dependencies and create symbolic links to packages.

If links stop working for some reason, run `npm run link` to fix links.

If you want to re-install dependencies, run `npm run clean` to clear all repositories (press "Y" to continue), then `npm run bootstrap` to install everything again.

## Documentation

Documentation for all packages is available on [Iconify documentation website](https://docs.iconify.design/implementations/):

-   [SVG framework documentation](https://docs.iconify.design/implementations/svg-framework/).
-   [Components documentation](https://docs.iconify.design/implementations/components/).
